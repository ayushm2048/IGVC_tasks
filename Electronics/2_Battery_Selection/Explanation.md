If we consider the substantial rise in vehicle weight, the total energy needed would be ( 48 * 30 * 1.15 + 150 ) * 2 / 82 * 100 = 4405Wh
And the maximum current would be 47 * 1.15 = 54A

I have attached a spreadsheet with all the calculations.

we can see that each battery provides energy around 1500Wh
So, we need at least three batteries.
Also, we need voltage of 48V. So, we have to put two batteries in series.

Eliminating all other options, we can connect two batteries in parallel and one in series to it.
As the maximum current needed is less than each of the maximum discharge of the batteries, we can use this combination.
Eliminating option c as it has least Capacity, lesser than the required.
Also eliminating option b as it has slowest charging and a very small capacity margin between the required and the battery's.
But we still cannot use this combination as the two batteries in the parallel don't run at their maximum current and their maximum power.

Hence, we need to use four batteries
The two possible options are 2P in series or 2S in parallel.
(If we use same type of batteries, these are same)

After working out some calculations, I found that E has highest capacity ( but gets charged the slowest ) but B gets charged in least amount of time.
We have a lot of excess power in all the cases, so we dont need to care about power shortage.
So, the next priority is the charging time.
Option B charges 12 minutes faster
E provides 384Wh more energy
Also, Option E has a lower C rate, which is generally better for battery longevity.

Hence, if we were to use same kinds of batteries, then we should use parallel combination of batteries due to its industry grade properties ( lower c rate = better lifespan , more energy )

If mixing battery types is possible, an optimized setup could involve using two batteries from Option B and two from Option E. This would balance charging speed and capacity, making it suitable for warehouse operations. However, this setup could involve performance degradation and other risks.
