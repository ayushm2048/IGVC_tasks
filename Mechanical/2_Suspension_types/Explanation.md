Suspension systems serve the purpose of providing comfort and good handling. 


There are two main types of suspensions, independent and dependent.

Independent suspension allows each wheel to move vertically without affecting the opposite wheel, providing ride comfort and handling.
These are common in passenger vehicles, particularly in the front suspension systems of modern vehicles and are mostly used in Passenger cars, sports cars, and SUVs.
However, these systems are more complex and costly.

Dependent suspension systems feature wheels that are interconnected, causing movements in one wheel to directly influence the other. 
This configuration uses a beam or axle that maintains wheels parallel to each other.
These offer durability and load-bearing capacity due to simple design and fewer moving parts and hence are used in trucks, off-road vehicles and old vehicles.
But these are less stable and less comfortable than independent systems


One such type of Independent suspension is MacPherson Strut Suspension

It is a type of automotive suspension system that uses the top of a telescopic damper as the upper steering pivot and is widely used in the front suspension of modern vehicles.

It c͏ombin͏es͏ a shock ab͏sorber a͏nd a coil spring ͏into a single͏ unit͏, savi͏ng space and ͏w͏eigh͏t. This is the reason the system is simple and contains less moving parts and is cost effective and easy to asssemble.

The upper strut mount is itself used as a damper as well as for turning the wheels, the turning motion of the wheels relies on the ball joints of the lower control arms and the strut bearing of the upper strut mount.
Hence, these suspensions are used in many of the economy cars due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness and is also used on some high performance cars after some customizations.
